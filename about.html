				<h2>About me</h2>
			</div>
			<div id="featured">
			<p>I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. My parents named me for "peace" (Latin!), which is a good indicator of what my childhood was like. Throughout school, I was one of the nerdy kids, working in accelerated programs, taking AP classes (including US History, Calculus, and Physics), and reading a lot. I left Tucson for college, majoring in Communication at Arizona State University, through the Barrett Honors College in Tempe. As part of my Honors coursework, I developed and co-taught a seminar for two semesters called Superheroes in American Culture, and authored a thesis called "Holy Hegemony, Batman: Violence and Masculinity in <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i>". This was before Heath Ledger's Joker and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Told you I was a nerdy kid. I was also an active participant in on-campus activities, working for Residential Life, the ASU Alumni Association, ASU Student Foundation, and serving a year as President of ASU Habitat for Humanity.</p>
			<p>After college, I tapped in to my creative side and started working as a portrait photographer. This led to a stint managing a photography studio in Chandler, AZ, which was a challenging and eye-opening experience. Through a co-worker, I met my future boss, who was single-handedly responsible for turning my life towards IT security. I had always been a logical and methodical person and, combined with my desire to push boundaries wherever possible, this gave me the opportunity to find a path for myself. I started working for GoDaddy as a customer service representative, learning as much as I possibly could about web servers, DNS, and the technologies that form the backbone of our interconnected world. I moved quickly to Advanced Hosting Support and then on to my first security job as a Customer Security Analyst. I learned a lot from that position, including malware analysis, basic penetration testing techniques, and forensics. I also had the opportunity to learn Python and help develop an in-house application for workflow automation. A new challenge came in the form of a security tester position for the US Courts, and I jumped at the opportunity. Now, I test new servers and applications for vulnerabilities and compliance, and produce risk assessment reports for the US Judiciary.</p>
			<p>Outside work, I still read a lot and have debates about politics, science, superheroes, and movies. I like to watch <i>Top Gear</i> and go to the Science Center with my two-year-old son. In my spare time, I brew beer under the name One Lane Brewing. I like to go running, hiking, and rowing, and I have competed in several races, including the Ragnar Trail and Tough Mudder. I also have written a screenplay about zombies, learned to play the <i>Skyrim</i> theme on guitar, spent time as an unpaid film critic, and built an unnecessarily large DVD collection.</p>
